  <h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>
      I'm taking this course to update what I know about web design. I've taken a few beginning web design classes in the past, but I'm out of practice &amp; I'd like to add web design to my skill set.  I hope by the end of this class I've learned a lot about HTML/CSS, built some awesome projects, and have a base to keep on learning!
    </p><br />
    <p>
        I'm a graphic designer for a children's sports company, so I get to spend my days using Photoshop &amp; Illustrator.
